Aim: To provide and test a theory of how voters perceive their local community and how this may be distorted by  political  context and characteristics and pre-dispositions of the individual citizen.

How does politics affect perceptions of place?

One of the motivating factors is the link between misperception and possible outcomes such as harder line attitudes about immigration policy, voting UKIP, and supporting BREXIT. Note these are policy attitudes/behaviours rather than values since values are amongst the factors that shape perceptions. It is difficult to separate these (ie. There's endogeneity) which is why we don’t focus on the outcomes at the same time as the inputs.  

We will focus on immigration perceptions as a highly politicised example, but can also look at perceived levels of unemployment, social class a

*Concepts*

Perceived characteristics can be regarded as a form of knowledge and as such are subject to inaccuracy. Inaccuracy has two components; error and bias. Error might be regarded as the randomly distributed difference around the objective (true) value which arises due to lack of knowledge. For example, if asked to guess the number of coins in a jar you might expect to fid a normal distribution of guesses with a mean equal to the true value. The average error would reflect the difficulty of the estimation and the ability/knowledge of the guesser. If most people guessed too high (the mean error was higher than the true mean) this is suggests bias. That is the non-random tendency of people to over or under estimate the quantity. In the case of immigration there is a well-documented tendency to overestimate (i.e bias).  

We aim to understand the source of bias, as distinct from error and explore the extent to which it is linked to:

 (a) potentially biased information or contexts  (e.g. media, partisan, political discussants, political campaigns)

(b) predispositions of  citizens (personal party ID, prejudice/attitudes about race and ethnocentrism etc)

(c) (exogenous) individual and contextual characteristics (individual -age, gender, personality, political knowledge/interest, frequency of discussion,  etc; contextual - urban-rural, size of area etc)

Differences in perception and reality can be shown by scatter plots of objective characteristics of area versus perceived characteristics. 

 

*Relevant literature/theories*

Motivated reasoning (Lodge and Taber etc)

Social identify theory (Tajfel and Turner; Huddy etc)

Bias in discussion networks (Huckfeld et al)

Political knowledge 

Contextual effects

*Data*

We have map data for Canada US and Britain can look across countries for common patterns of misperception and then use BES to test the more detailed theory

For GB we need to link objective data by LSOA matching. LSAOs are a census geography with 1000-3000 people  and we have codes for BESIP members. There is possibility of comparing with 2001 data as there is considerable continuity (though it might be tricky)

"Maintaining stability as far as possible was key for the 2011 Census. LSOAs and MSOAs created following the 2001 Census continue to exist unless a significant population change occurred between 2001 and 2011, and household minimum and maximum thresholds were breached. Simplistically, where populations have become too big, the LSOAs/MSOAs have been split into two or more areas; where populations have become too small, the LSOAs/MSOAs have been merged with an adjacent one. Responses to the Output Geography Consultation from December 2009 to March 2010 were also considered in the redesign of OAs and SOAs. Consequently, the total changes across the OA hierarchy were no more than 5% overall."

Population and household minimum and maximum thresholds for SOAs in England and Wales:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Geography</td>
    <td>Minimum population</td>
    <td>Maximum population</td>
    <td>Minimum number of houseolds</td>
    <td>Maximum number of households</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>LSOA</td>
    <td>1,000</td>
    <td>3,000</td>
    <td>400</td>
    <td>1,200</td>
  </tr>
</table>


Mapping questions (wave 2) variable listed below

Network data (wave 2) including ethnicity and partisanship of discussants

Media – what papers they read (e.g. grouped papers according to position on immigration  - Mail, Express, Telegraph, Sun…) – not measured until later (wave 4)

Individual level campaign exposure (contact)

*Contextual data*

Party campaign spending 2010/2015 – note I think we have spending over 'long campaign' so this will be reasonably timely. 

Local Election results (2013, 2014)

* Create latent variable of 'ukippiness' from these

Mapping questions.

What they were thinking of when they defined the area

 How strongly the respondent feels they belong to their community

 Whether they live or work in the local community

 How long they have lived in the local community

 The number of people they know by name in their local community

 Perceived economic performance in their local community

 Perceived inequality in the local community

 Perceived level of unemployment in the local community

 Perceived level of unemployment nationally

 Perceived electoral turnout in the local community

 Perceived percentage support for each of the parties in the local community (Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, UKIP, Greens, Plaid Cymru)

 Perceived proportion of working class and middle people in the local community

 Perceived proportion of black, Asian and white people in the local community

 Perceived proportion of people not born in the UK in the local community

 Perceived change in diversity in local community
