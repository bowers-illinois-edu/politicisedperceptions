Perhaps ideas about dissimilarity between the relevant context and the objective context. Difference between LSOA characteristics of the person and the constituency level: what if the LSOA is 50% white but the Constituency is 90% white (i.e. your LSOA is weird). This might also be the case if you have differences between personally relevant context.

We don't want to theorize why people get things wrong and make errors.

Maybe education relationship with misperceptions arises because lower education or higher is more highly biased –- more politicized.

Sources of Bias: propensity to notice difference (personality, openness) that may not be politicized, 

Sources of Error: sighted versus blind, 

Jelly bean jar guessing analogy.

V.O.Key worked because politics was held constant. Other inconsistencies in results arise because perceptions matter and perceptions are politiicized/manipulable by political actors.

Census data: 2001, 2011. Probably 1 million more immigrants since 2011.

# Sources of information (inputs into the cognitively biased and motivated reasoner):

Very slow moving: Education, Gender, Socialization, ?Personality? [conditions]

Medium speed: Demographic change

Fast: Campaign [catalysts]

Then, individual (from distant past, what you bring), and contextual (demographics and campaign).

Affect, PID, Ethnocentrism. 

What might change how you process information and complete the survey task?

# Can we change perceptions? If they matter, can we change them?

PID might distort. It is in the interest of parties to do this.  A strategic outcome.

Education might increase accuracy.

Politics is a competition to describe reality. Not just about policy debate about actual construction  of understandings of society.

Biasy-Error:  over-reaction to change.

Smallest unit: LSOA

Misperception as a symptom of anti-immigrant populism. : more where people lost out from globalization, more with aging populations, unemployed people.

Immigration became a salient concern. EU, opening borders. 

Why anti-establishment parties? National politics makes something salient. 

Campaigns might change judgments about perceptions.

People who are very sensitive to immigrants + proportion immigrants lead to UKIP-style voting more in those places.

Relationship between perceptions and objective probably non-linear.

What are perceptions?

- merely something about the person: prejudice

- merely something about the person: information

- merely something about the person: who you are

- objective context plus error (basically lived experience plus innocuous error) — or plus anti-outgroup based bias/error

- the outcomes of a political process that knows about these things and takes advantage of these things.: policy environment (state) and political competitors (parties)

Are misperceivers more likely to vote for UKIP?

The effects of politics on place. How place becomes political?

People in denial about global warming: pre-existing, predisposition interacting with experience and with information. 

Also people disagree about policy.

Pernicious politics about truth and description of reality versus about judgements about it.

Distorted information and biased filtering of the information.

Immigration happens.

Some people prone to worry.

Politics comes along and makes it worse. (information manipulated or distorted by politics also distorted/biased by what you bring to the moment of learning)

UKIP making immigration salient.

Politicization worsens misperceptions: media, etc..

Why is the reality of immigration becoming a political problem? Has to go through perceptions and politics as they interact.

This paper presents a theory of perception.

Lots of reasons to presume political competition on the weighting of considerations in final political decisions. 

- self reported contact by political parties.

- constituency level campaign spending to each respondent: roughly 650 constituencies. (631 constituency).

- respondent based reports up to three people with whom you discuss politics, including their ethnicity. 

- how many people they could name in their mapping module

Perceptions of unemployment and partisanship versus perceptions of immigrations.

### The politicization of (social) perceptions: Roots of perceptual bias.

The social bases of politics are psychological and perceptual. And these perceptions are caused by politics. Thus, very difficult to talk about context effects on politics independent of politics. 

Politicized media  (asked after perceptions)

Constituency Level UKIP vote 2010, 2015

Constituency Level UKIP spending 2010, 2015

Constituency level immigration

Individual contact

Partisanship of your three top discussion people (or first person)

Size of their community network

Perceived partisanship of the area

Perceived black, asian, white of the area

Objective black, asian, white of the constituency.

How strongly belong to place.

Aggregate reported UKIP in your community.

Local government  for UKIP candidates: 2013, 2014.

Common factors: Objective context, knowledge, prejudice, pid

Varying: politics and policy environment. 

Implications for discussion groups, implications for perceptions of your own local community from 2010 spending and vote from UKIP. (i.e. politicization of facts).

Policy environment: unemployment, age, homogeneity (threat) also objective immigration.: moderation of effects.

Incorrect perceptions can arise from perceiving a problem in the economy or threat.

"I think there is a jobs crisis or a housing crisis because of too many immigrants. “
