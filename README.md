# Politicised Perceptions

This is a repository to organize work on the project on the politicization of perceptions of context.

Some of our work is in Google Drive, that stuff is published as markdown files in MemosAndNotes using the [Gabriel plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gabriel/okimajjeocnndpifeelaajdebkkbckff?hl=en-GB) for Google Docs <https://github.com/thiscouldbejd/Gabriel> 

In general, this is a place for plain text files, like .do or .R or .Rmd or .Rnw or .csv files (that are not too big). For real time collaboration, we will tend to use Google Docs. And for large file sharing, we will use Dropbox. (At least for now.)
